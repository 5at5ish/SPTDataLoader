Authentication and back-off logic is a pain, let's do it once and forget about it! This is a library that allows you to centralise this logic and forget about the ugly parts of making HTTP requests.

- [x] üì± iOS 7.0+
- [x] üíª OS X 10.8+
- [x] ‚åöÔ∏è watchOS 2.0+
- [x] üì∫ tvOS 9.0+

## Architecture :triangular_ruler:
`SPTDataLoader` is designed as an HTTP stack with 3 additional layers on top of `NSURLSession`.

- **The Application level**, which controls the rate limiting and back-off policies per service, respecting the ‚ÄúRetry-After‚Äù header and knowing when or not it should retry the request.
- **The User level**, which controls the authentication of the HTTP requests.
- **The View level**, which allows automatic cancellation of requests the view has made upon deallocation.

### Authentication :key:
The authentication in this case is abstract, allowing the creator of the SPTDataLoaderFactory to define their own semantics for token acquisition and injection. It allows for asynchronous token acquisition if the token is invalid that seamlessly integrates with the HTTP request-response pattern.

### Back-off policy :cop:
The data loader service allows rate limiting of URLs to be set explicitly or to be determined by the server using the ‚ÄúRetry-After‚Äù semantic. It allows back-off retrying by using a jittered exponential backoff to prevent the thundering hordes creating a request storm after a predictable exponential period has expired.

## Installation
SPTDataLoader can be installed in a variety of ways including traditional static libraries and dynamic frameworks. As well as using either of the dependency managers Cocoapods and Carthage.

### Static Library
Simply include `SPTDataLoader.xcodeproj` in your App‚Äôs Xcode project, and link your app with the library in the ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù section.

### CocoaPods
We are indexed on [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org), which can be installed using [Ruby gems](https://rubygems.org/):
```shell
$ gem install cocoapods
```
Then simply add `SPTDataLoader` to your `Podfile`.
```
pod 'SPTDataLoader', '~> 1.0'
```
Lastly let CocoaPods do it thing by running:
```shell
$ cocoapods update
```

### Carthage
We support [Carthage](https://github.con/Carthage/Carthage) and provide pre-built binary frameworks for all new releases. Start by making sure you have the latest version of Carthage installed, e.g. using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```shell
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
You will also need to add `SPTDataLoader` to your `Cartfile`:
```
github 'spotify/SPTDataLoader' ~> 1.0
```
After that is all said and done, let Carthage pull in SPTDataLoader like so:
```shell
$ carthage update
```
Next up, you need to add the framework to the Xcode project of your App. Lastly link the framework with your App and copy it to the App‚Äôs Frameworks directory under the ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù.

## Usage example :eyes:
For an example of this framework's usage, see the demo application `SPTDataLoaderDemo` in `SPTDataLoader.xcodeproj`. Just follow the instructions in [`ClientKeys.h`](demo/ClientKeys.h).

### Creating the SPTDataLoaderService
In your app you should only have 1 instance of SPTDataLoaderService, ideally you would construct this in something similar to an AppDelegate. It takes in a rate limiter, resolver, user agent and an array of NSURLProtocols. The rate limiter allows objects outside the service to change the rate limiting for different endpoints, the resolver allows overriding of host names, and the array of NSURLProtocols allows support for protocols other than http/s.
```objc
SPTDataLoaderRateLimiter *rateLimiter = [SPTDataLoaderRateLimiter rateLimiterWithDefaultRequestsPerSecond:10.0];
SPTDataLoaderResolver *resolver = [SPTDataLoaderResolver new];
self.service = [SPTDataLoaderService dataLoaderServiceWithUserAgent:@"Spotify-Demo"
                                                        rateLimiter:rateLimiter
                                                           resolver:resolver
                                           customURLProtocolClasses:nil];
```
Note that you can provide all these as nils if you are so inclined, it may be for the best to use nils until you identify a need for these different configuration options.

### Defining your own SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser
If you don't need to authenticate your requests you can skip this. In order to authenticate your requests against a backend, you are required to create an implementation of the SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser, the demo project has an example in its SPTDataLoaderAuthoriserOAuth class. In this example we are checking if the request is for the domain which we are attempting to authenticate for, and then performing the authentication (in this case we are injecting an Auth Token into the HTTP header). This interface is asynchronous to allow you to perform token refreshes while a request is in flight in order to hold it until it is ready to be authenticated. Once you have a valid token you can call the delegate (which in this case will be the factory) in order to inform it that the request has been authenticated. Alternatively if you are unable to authenticate the request tell the delegate about the error.

### Creating the SPTDataLoaderFactory
Your app should ideally only create an SPTDataLoaderFactory once your user has logged in or if you require no authentication for your calls. The factory controls the authorisation of the different requests against authoriser objects that you construct.
```objc
id<SPTDataLoaderAuthoriser> oauthAuthoriser = [[SPTDataLoaderAuthoriserOAuth alloc] initWithDictionary:oauthTokenDictionary];
self.oauthFactory = [self.service createDataLoaderFactoryWithAuthorisers:@[ oauthAuthoriser ]];
```
What we are doing here is using an implementation of an authoriser to funnel all the requests created by this factory into these authorisers.

### Creating the SPTDataLoader
Your app should create an SPTDataLoader object per view that wants to make requests (e.g. it is best not too share these between classes). This is so when your view model is deallocated the requests made by your view model will also be cancelled.
```objc
SPTDataLoader *dataLoader = [self.oauthFactory createDataLoader];
```
Note that this data loader will only authorise requests that are made available by the authorisers supplied to its factory.

### Creating the SPTDataLoaderRequest
In order to create a request the only information you will need is the URL and where the request came from. For more advanced requests see the properties on SPTDataLoaderRequest which let you change the method, timeouts, retries and whether to stream the results.
```objc
SPTDataLoaderRequest *request = [SPTDataLoaderRequest requestWithURL:meURL
                                                    sourceIdentifier:@"playlists"];
[self.dataLoader performRequest:request];
```
After you have made the request your data loader will call its delegate regarding results of the requests.

### Handling Streamed Requests
Sometimes you will want to process HTTP requests as they come in packet by packet rather than receive a large callback at the end, this works better for memory and certain forms of media. For Spotify's purpose, it works for streaming MP3 previews of our songs. An example of using the streaming API:
```objc
void AudioSampleListener(void *, AudioFileStreamID, AudioFileStreamPropertyID, UInt32 *);
void AudioSampleProcessor(void *, UInt32, UInt32, const void *, AudioStreamPacketDescription *);

- (void)load
{
    NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://i.spotify.com/mp3_preview"];
    SPTDataLoaderRequest *request = [SPTDataLoaderRequest requestWithURL:URL sourceIdentifier:@"preview"];
    request.chunks = YES;
    [self.dataLoader performRequest:request];
}

- (void)dataLoader:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader
didReceiveDataChunk:(NSData *)data
       forResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response
{
    void *mp3Data = calloc(data.length, 1);
    memcpy(mp3Data, data.bytes, data.length);
    AudioFileStreamParseBytes(_audioFileStream, data.length, mp3Data, 0);
    free(mp3Data);
}

- (void)dataLoader:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader didReceiveInitialResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response
{
    AudioFileStreamOpen((__bridge void *)self,
                        AudioSampleListener,
                        AudioSampleProcessor,
                        kAudioFileMP3Type,
                        &_audioFileStream);
}

- (BOOL)dataLoaderShouldSupportChunks:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader
{
    return YES;
}
```
Be sure to render YES in your delegate to tell the data loader that you support chunks, and to set the requests chunks property to YES.

## Background story :book:
At Spotify we have begun moving to a decentralised HTTP architecture, and in doing so have had some growing pains. Initially we had a data loader that would attempt to refresh the access token whenever it became invalid, but we immediately learned this was very hard to keep track of. We needed some way of injecting this authorisation data automatically into a HTTP request that didn't require our features to do any more heavy lifting than they were currently doing.

Thus we came up with a way to elegantly inject tokens in a Just-in-time manner for requests that require them. We also wanted to learn from our mistakes with our proprietary protocol, and bake in back-off policies early to avoid us DDOSing our own backends with huge amounts of eronious requests.

### Why no block interface?
We had some block interfaces on our proprietary protocol library, and what we noticed was that it was easy to miss the weakification of the variables used in the blocks, which caused view models to be held around in memory far longer than they should have been.
Another problem was whether we should use one block or multiple blocks for failures/successes, and what we learned from our old API was that developers could tend to miss failure states from a single block interface (e.g. handle an NSError passed in). Good examples of are animation blocks on UIView that do not take into account the failed BOOL passed in. This makes it necessary to use multiple blocks, however we wanted a contract where the developer was guaranteed to get a callback from the data loader on any of its ending states (even if they put in a nil to the request blocks). The way we achieved this was the use of the delegate pattern.
Unfortunately the block pattern is useful in a number of different scenarios, however it is far from our main use case at Spotify. To support this we would like to point out that someone can give the userInfo of a request a block and then call that block on the delegate callback if they were so inclined (we have one or two examples of this on our codebase).
```objc
- (void)load
{
    UILabel *label = [self findLabel];
    NSURL *URL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://www.spotify.com"];
    SPTDataLoaderRequest *request = [SPTDataLoaderRequest requestWithURL:URL sourceIdentifier:@"spotify"];
    dispatch_block_t block = ^ {
        label.text = @"Loaded";
    };
    request.userInfo = @{ @"block" : block };
    [self.dataLoader performRequest:request];
}

- (void)dataLoader:(SPTDataLoader *)dataLoader didReceiveSuccessfulResponse:(SPTDataLoaderResponse *)response
{
    dispatch_block_t block = response.request.userInfo[@"block"];
    if (block) {
        block();
    }
}
```
